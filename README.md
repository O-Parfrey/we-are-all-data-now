# We Are All Data Now

An ARPG roguelike concept focused on persistent progression, experimental builds, and systems-driven gameplay.

## Overview
We Are All Data Now is a design and systems exploration for a top-down action roguelike that blends elements of looter shooters, bullet hells, and ARPGs. The core focus is on player-driven build experimentation and long-term progression across runs rather than single-run mastery.

## Design Focus
- Persistent character progression across runs
- Experimental build paths driven by gear and upgrades
- Open route selection toward objectives
- Multiple playable characters with distinct mechanics
- Replayability through branching paths and endings

## Core Concept
Players choose from multiple characters, each with unique strengths and playstyles, and engage in short, high-intensity runs. Gear, upgrades, and progression choices persist beyond individual runs, allowing players to gradually push further and experiment with increasingly complex builds.
